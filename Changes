Revision history for Perl extension PAR::Repository::Client.

0.21_02  Tue Jan 13 20:06 2009
    - Support for setting custom cache directories with
      the cache_dir parameter to new().
    - Set PAR_TEMP to a real temporary directory with cleanup
      for the tests so there are not files leftover after
      testing (RT #30018)

0.21_01  Tue Jan 13 18:00 2009
    - Fix return values of modules_dbm and scripts_dbm:
      Formerly, they would only return the hash (not the file)
      if the checksums matched.
    - Fix return value of need_dbm_update on success. Documented
      to be the empty list, was 0.
    - Fix need_dbm_update in case the checksums had never been
      fetched before.
    - Fix autovivification bug in _fetch_module(). (very minor)
    - Fix bug in _fetch_module()
    - Much, MUCH better tests.

    - Support for manually specifying the preferred architecture
      and perl version.

0.18  Tue Jun  3 15:29 2008
    - Don't refetch DBM files when deemed not necessary because the
      checksums match..

      supports them.

      private utility methods.

    - PAR::Repository::Client::prefered_distribution was silently dropping

0.14  Mon Oct 12 16:05 2006
    - PAR::Repository::Client::HTTP::_fetch_file was generating rather
